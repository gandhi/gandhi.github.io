Startup Shell
ETA BATCH 2015 - present
The best community. Ever.
<a href = "startupshell.org">Startup Shell</a> is a student-run incubator at the University of Maryland. I applied with the startup idea "tutorme", and was accepted into the Eta Batch. The people I work with everyday at the shell provide the perfect environemnt for creativity and a ton of fun. Shellers introduced me to hackathons, and without them, I would not have done many side projects at all. Currently, I am working to institute the "Creative in Residence" program (more to come later).
