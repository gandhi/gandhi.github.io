Responsible volunteerism.
I wanted to do a service trip to a third world country, and am so happy I picked SHH. The <a href = "http://shhkids.org/">organization</a> has not only provided me a valuable experience, but also insight on how proper volunteerism (vs. irresponsible volunteerism) is extremely important. I plan to go on these trips for the rest of my winter breaks.
