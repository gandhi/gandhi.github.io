Terrapin Hackers
PRESIDENT 2015 - present
Making UMD the hacker school it was always meant to be.
The hacker community at UMD is something I would never have expected. It's a huge community that only wants to keep growing. Specifically, I am the president and am working to expand the club so all new hackers have access. I helped revitalize Collider, the hackerspace for the organization. In addition, I re-designed the <a href = "terrapinhackers.com">website</a> and introduced the <a href = "https://medium.com/terrapin-hackers/10-terrapin-hacks-from-mhacks-refactor-f5e325c9aa47#.2e8u7fu5v">mentorship program</a>.
