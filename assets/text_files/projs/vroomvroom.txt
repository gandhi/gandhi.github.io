Best Hardware Hack - HoyaHacks 2016 (01/16)
Control a Spark Core car with an Oculus and Myo
My team built a Jenga car powered by servos and a Spark Core (basically a wireless arduino). By attaching an iPhone to stream video, we could create a 3D environment for a user on a computer using Oculus VR and Virtual Desktop. This user could remotely control the car using basic WASD controls. In addition, we added controllability via Myo Armband; different gestures signalled different movements.
