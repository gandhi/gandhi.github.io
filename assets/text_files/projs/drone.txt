Hack to support Technica 2015 (11/15)
Painting a canvas with a drone for the first time in history.
For Technica (all-ladies hackathon), a team of me and four others built software to get a drone to automatically splatter paint on a canvas. This was basically like a mini-hackathon, we on midnight on Friday, and had 36 hours to get it done. We used nodejs for the automation.
